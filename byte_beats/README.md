Byte beats are a way of generating 8-bit sounds using code. The advantages of using byte-beats are:
* small size(it's just a small piece of code)
* retro feel
* ease of editing and experimenting

I first found about them when I tried looking for the sound files for EggNog. Instead of finding normal `mp3`/`ogg`/`wav` files, I found text files. Me and my roommate spent the rest of the day writing and trying out random code snippets.

To play a byte-beat, do `./play.sh <name-of-c-file>`. I would recommend trying out `tune.c` first. Because it's the nicest one.

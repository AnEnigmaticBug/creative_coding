This is a landfill of sorts for my small creative coding demos. None of them is big enough to merit it's own repository but I still want to preserve them. So I made this one big repo.


## Contents

Each directory has a separate README with screenshot(s)/small video of the corresponding demo.

| Dir Name            | Description                                                              | Environment |

|`force_bubbles`      | Use noise to generate force fields which acts on bubbles                 | Processing  |
|`noisy_kaleidoscope` | Use noise + symmetry to create nice patterns                             | Processing  |
|`terrain`            | Simple 3D terrain generation(hills, valleys + lakes)                     | Processing  |

A lot of these demos were made by following The Coding Train's channel on YouTube. Directories with names of the form `cc_<no>` correspond to his coding challenges.
